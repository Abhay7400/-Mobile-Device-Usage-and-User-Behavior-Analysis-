Project: Mobile Usage Behavior Classification

In this project, I analyzed a mobile usage dataset to classify user behavior based on various usage patterns such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and more. The analysis involved:

Univariate Analysis: I examined individual features such as app usage time and battery drain to understand their distributions and identify potential outliers.
Bivariate Analysis: I explored relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., app usage vs. user behavior class) using visualizations such as scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.
Multivariate Analysis: I applied techniques like correlation matrices and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to investigate the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously, detecting highly correlated features and reducing dimensionality when necessary.
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: I implemented a preprocessing pipeline using ColumnTransformer to apply scaling to numerical features and one-hot encoding to categorical features. This ensured that the dataset was well-prepared for model training.
Model Building: After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I developed a classification model to predict user behavior classes based on mobile usage patterns, achieving insights into key factors influencing different behavior types.
This project highlights the end-to-end process of analyzing mobile usage data and building predictive models for user behavior classification.
